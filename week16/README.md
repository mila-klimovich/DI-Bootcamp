# Global Tech Talk: Sentiment Analysis of Tweets about Big Tech Companies

## Description

In this project, I analyze public sentiment toward some of the world's biggest tech companies — including Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta (Facebook) — using Twitter data. Social media is a powerful space where people share opinions, frustrations, and praise in real time. My goal is to uncover how these companies are perceived by the public, what people talk about, and how sentiment varies between brands.

This project is part of a Hackathon and allows me to practice real-world data skills, including cleaning messy data, exploring patterns, visualizing trends, and presenting insights clearly.

## Objective

- To understand how people feel about different tech companies based on Twitter data.
- To compare sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) across companies.
- To explore which keywords are most frequently mentioned in tweets for each brand.
- To practice working with real-world datasets using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- To develop a strong storytelling approach based on data insights.

## Data Source

**Dataset:** [Big Tech Companies - Tweet Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwanm786/big-tech-companies-tweet-sentiment)  
This dataset contains two CSV files of tweets mentioning major tech companies. Each tweet is labeled with a sentiment category: positive, neutral, or negative. The dataset allows me to explore public discussions and reactions to tech brands on Twitter.

## Key Tasks

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments across different tech companies. Analyze the volume of tweets per brand, and assess the balance between positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Use descriptive statistics and visual summaries to identify potential trends, outliers, or anomalies in the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Clean the text data by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and converting all text to lowercase. Handle missing values if any, and encode sentiment labels into numerical format. Prepare the dataset for analysis using tokenization, normalization, and basic text preprocessing techniques.

### 3. Feature Exploration
Identify the most frequently used keywords and hashtags in tweets for each company. Examine the distribution of key terms across sentiment categories to reveal how certain words are associated with positive or negative sentiment. If timestamps are available, analyze how sentiment changes over time.

### 4. Visualization
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, word clouds, and box plots. Visualize sentiment distribution per company, keyword frequencies, and comparisons across brands. These visual tools will support data storytelling and highlight key insights.

### 5. Bonus: Brand Sentiment Comparison
Compare sentiment ratios and scores between companies to determine which brand receives the most positive or negative attention. Summarize findings with comparative visuals to highlight differences in public perception.
