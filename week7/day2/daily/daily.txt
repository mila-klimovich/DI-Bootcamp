Step 1: 
Amazon leverages data analytics across many aspects of its B2C operations. A major area is its dynamic pricing strategy, where the company adjusts prices of products in real time based on a wide variety of data points, including customer behavior, competitor pricing, inventory levels, time of day, and even weather conditions.

Step 2: 
Data used: Browsing history, purchase patterns, competitor data, sales velocity.
Methods: Machine learning algorithms, A/B testing, predictive modeling.
Outcomes: Real-time price changes, optimized recommendations, and inventory management.

Step 3: 
Without this deep data insight:
Prices wouldn’t be competitive.
Customers wouldn’t receive personalized offers.
Inventory would be harder to manage, causing overstock or shortages.
Data analysis allows Amazon to respond instantly to changing demand and stay ahead in a highly competitive B2C market.

Step 4: 
Amazon’s case shows how real-time data analysis enables smarter pricing, better customer experience, and operational efficiency. This is a prime example of data transforming decision-making in retail.
